    question: "My garage door is making unusual noises. What could be causing this?",
    answer:
      "Noisy garage doors typically indicate developing problems that should be addressed promptly. Common causes include: 1) Loose hardware - bolts and screws can loosen over time due to door movement and vibration; 2) Worn rollers - metal rollers wear out and become noisy, while nylon rollers offer quieter operation; 3) Insufficient lubrication - moving parts need regular lubrication with silicone-based garage door lubricant; 4) Worn bearings in pulleys or the opener motor; 5) Damaged hinges or springs; 6) Opener chain issues - chains can become loose or need lubrication. These issues often worsen over time and can lead to more serious problems if not addressed. Contact us for a free diagnostic assessment - our technicians can identify the specific cause of the noise and recommend the most effective solution for your particular door system.",

    question: "My garage door won't close completely. What's causing this problem?",
    answer:
      "A garage door that won't close completely is usually caused by one of these issues: 1) Misaligned or blocked safety sensors - the photo-eye sensors near the floor must have clear line-of-sight; 2) Incorrect limit settings - the opener's down-limit switch may need adjustment; 3) Track obstructions or damage - debris or bent tracks can prevent full closure; 4) Broken springs or cables - causing the door to be unbalanced; 5) Worn rollers or hinges - creating binding during operation; 6) Opener logic board issues - sometimes requiring reprogramming or replacement. This is a safety issue that should be addressed promptly. Our technicians can diagnose and fix the specific cause during an on-site assessment.

    question: "Is it better to repair my existing garage door or replace it with a new one?",
    answer:
      "This decision depends on several factors: 1) Age of the door - doors over 15-20 years old are often candidates for replacement; 2) Extent of damage - significant panel damage, severe rust, or structural issues often make replacement worth considering; 3) Energy efficiency - newer doors offer better insulation (higher R-values compared to older doors); 4) Repair history - frequent repairs indicate declining reliability; 5) Safety features - older doors may lack modern safety features; 6) Aesthetic considerations - a new door can significantly improve curb appeal and home value. Every situation is unique, and what makes sense for one homeowner might not be right for another. We provide honest assessments and detailed comparisons of both options during our free on-site consultations. Contact us to schedule an evaluation, and we'll help you make the most informed decision for your specific circumstances.",

    question: "Do I need to be home during the garage door installation?",
    answer:
      "We recommend that an adult (18+) is present during garage door installation, especially at the beginning to confirm design choices and at the end for the final inspection and operation tutorial. This ensures the installation meets your expectations and that you understand how to operate and maintain your new door system. However, we understand scheduling challenges and can make arrangements if you cannot be present the entire time. Our installation team is background-checked, uniformed, and highly professional. If you need to step away during part of the installation, our technicians can continue working independently.
